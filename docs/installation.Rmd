title: "Before The Workshop"
---


Again, because this is a four hour workshop, we ask that you come prepared with
a laptop that has the most recent versions of [R] and [RStudio] installed, and
our [workshop materials] downloaded to your Desktop. 

Installation
------------

Even if you already have [R] installed on your system, you really should make
sure its up to date. This ensures that there are no problems due to outdated
software. For more details about installing [R], [RStudio], and keeping
everything up to date, UBC's [STAT545] page is an excellent resource.

 - [R]
 - [RStudio]
 - [Workshop Materials] (zip file; unzip to Desktop)
 - (Once you've installed R) packages "[dplyr]" and "[ggplot2]"

Verification
------------

Once you have installed [R], we should verify that you have the correct version.

 1. Open R (or RStudio) on your computer
 2. Enter the following in the R console after the `>`    
        
        R.version.string == "R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02)"
        
 3. Make sure the result is **`[1] TRUE`**    
    (If the result is `[1] FALSE`, please quit R and try the installation again)
 
 
Workshop Materials
------------------

Our [workshop materials] is a zip file that contains a folder called 
`IntroR-master/` with the folowing structure:

```
.
├── IntroR_Workshop.Rproj
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
├── Part1-Introduction.R
├── Part2-Analysis.R
├── Part3-Visualization.R
├── README.md
├── data/
│   ├── fungicide_dat.csv
│   └── README.md
└── docs/
    └── ...
```

We are providing the R scripts for the workshop, so that you can easily 
execute the code in these scripts to follow along.

Installing Packages
-------------------

To install [dplyr] and [ggplot2] to your system, open R and type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2"), repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
```
